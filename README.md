                                         CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

Customer retention is critical for banks and financial institutions. Acquiring new customers costs significantly more than retaining existing ones. In this project, your task is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) based on their demographic information, account details, and banking behavior.
Understanding the factors that lead to customer churn helps banks take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.
